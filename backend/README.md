# Backend
 
## Development
### IDE
Before pushing your code, you have to format it and organize imports.
The former is pretty standard and the configuration used on IntelliJ for the later can be configured in `Code Style/Java/Imports`.

![Java Imports](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4922020/5725146/c639881e-9b50-11e4-981b-80ad11a93776.png)

You should note that `*` is used only if more than 20 classes are used, and that static imports are done before the `java`
 and `javax` packages, and then the other imports.


### Jetty
To start a jetty server

    mvn jetty:run
    
For debugging purpose

    mvnDebug jetty:run
    
Default configuration launch jetty on http://localhost:8080/, source code is _watched_ every two seconds to enable hot reload of modified code

### Gulp
While editing backend js files, extra build steps are performed when building war. For development purpose you can launch jetty via gulp. This will 'watch' js files and rebuild them every time a change happens

    gulp serve

## Unit test code coverage
To run unit test code coverage, launch maven profile _coverage_
    
    mvn clean test -Pcoverage
    

###Javascript test 
#### Single run

```shell
$ yarn test
```
or
```shell
$ gulp test
```

## Licensing 
The build will check if the license is correctly added and up to date in each files, and fail if that's not the case. 
    
If you want to add or update the license, run :
 
    mvn license:format
    
If you want to run the check manually :

    mvn license:check
