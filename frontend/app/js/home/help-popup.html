                Use the UI Designer to create or edit web artifacts: <b>application pages</b> composing business
                applications, <b>process forms</b> linked to process instantiation or human
                tasks execution, as well as <b>application layouts</b>, applied to all pages of a business application.

                An artifact designed with the UI Designer can be exported to be shared with teammates (import in the UI
                Designer) or used in business applications (import in Bonita Portal).

                There is a set of <b>default widgets</b> for displaying information to and for gathering information
                from the end users. You can also create
                <b>custom widgets</b>.

                        Starting with version 7.7.0, the name of a UI artifact becomes its unique identifier, instead of
                        a
                        randomized identifier. This will make them easier to find in Bonita repositories.
                        You may rename existing artifacts so they benefit from this change too.
                    </p>
                    <p class="alert alert-warning" translate>
                        Because of this change, if you receive a fragment, rename it and then share it back, it will be
                        considered as a new file by the other Bonita Studios or UI Designers.
