                Use the UI Designer to create or edit web artifacts: <b>application pages</b> composing business
                applications, <b>process forms</b> linked to process instantiation or human
                tasks execution, as well as <b>application layouts</b>, applied to all pages of a business application.
            </p>
            <p translate>Artifact creation:</p>
            <ul>
                <li translate>Create an <b>application page</b> directly in the UI Designer</li>
                <li translate>Start creating a <b>process form</b> in Bonita Studio: from the appropriate pool or
                    human task, create a contract and launch the UI Designer. It will auto-generate a dedicated form to
                    edit.
                </li>
                <li translate>Start creating an <b>application layout</b> by importing the default layout, available in
                    the Bonita Portal
                    resources, and edit it.

                An artifact designed with the UI Designer can be exported to be shared with teammates (import in the UI
                Designer) or used in business applications (import in Bonita Portal).

                There is a set of <b>default widgets</b> for displaying information to and for gathering information
                from the end users. You can also create
                <b>custom widgets</b>.

                The UI Designer generates <b>standard html application code, based on AngularJS</b>. Export pages if you
                want to further customize them in a
                different favorite web development environment.

            <h2 translate>Bonita 7.8</h2>
            <dt translate>New modal container to create pop-ins</dt>
            <p translate>
                Available in the palette, it opens over the content of a page/form/layout. To manage such containers,
                the Button widget gains two actions: "Open modal" and "Close modal".
            </p>
            <dt translate>Change the type of a UI Designer artifact (page/form)</dt>
            <p translate>
                From the page or form editors, right by the "Save" button, a click on the arrow displays a new option
                "Convert to...". It has also been added in the "Save as" option to, for example, save a form as a case
                overview page.
            </p>
            <dt translate>Edit the display name and display description of a page, form, or layout from the Editor</dt>
            <p translate>
                Display name and description are used when the page, form, or layout are imported in the portal's
                Resources page. To edit them, click on the new "Tag" button.
            </p>
            <dt translate>Summary of the calls to Bonita REST API made in a page, form, or layout</dt>
            <p translate>
                The same "Tag" button displays a summary of all REST API calls made by the current artifact to the
                Bonita REST API."
            </p>
            <h2 translate>Bonita 7.7</h2>
            <dt translate>Identifier</dt>
            <p translate>
                Starting with version 7.7.0, the name of a UI artifact becomes its unique identifier, instead of a
                randomized identifier. This will make them easier to find in Bonita repositories.
                You may rename existing artifacts so they benefit from this change too.
            </p>
            <p class="alert alert-warning" translate>
                Because of this change, if you receive a fragment, rename it and then share it back, it will be
                considered as a new file by the other Bonita Studios or UI Designers.
