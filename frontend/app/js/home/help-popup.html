                Use the UI Designer to create or edit web artifacts: <b>application pages</b> composing business
                applications, <b>process forms</b> linked to process instantiation or human
                tasks execution, as well as <b>application layouts</b>, applied to all pages of a business application.

                </li>
                <li translate>Start creating an <b>application layout</b> by importing the default layout, available in

                An artifact designed with the UI Designer can be exported to be shared with teammates (import in the UI
                Designer) or used in business applications (import in Bonita Portal).

                There is a set of <b>default widgets</b> for displaying information to and for gathering information
                from the end users. You can also create
                <b>custom widgets</b>.

                The UI Designer generates <b>standard html application code, based on AngularJS</b>. Export pages if you
