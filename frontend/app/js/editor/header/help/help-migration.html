    <h4 translate>Migration notes</h4>
    <h5 translate>7.5.0</h5>
    <p translate>Since 7.5.0, UI Bootstrap is no longer provided in the UI Designer pages.</p>
    <p translate>To keep things working, if you migrate a page designed in a version older than 7.5.0 and containing custom widgets, <em>ui-bootstrap-tpls-0.13.0.min.js</em> will be added as an asset of your page automatically. You can remove it if you don't need it.</p>
    <p translate>For new artifacts, you need to add the asset yourself in the custom widgets or pages that require it.</p>
    <br>
    <h5 translate>7.12.0</h5>
    <p translate>Since 7.12.0, after an artifact has been migrated, a migration report <i class="fa fa-wrench status"></i> is available from the editor header. It disappears once the page is refreshed, but can be retrieved in the UI Designer log file.</p>
